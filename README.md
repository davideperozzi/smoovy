## Synopsis
**smoovy** is a collection of small, useful and well tested js packages preventing copy & paste. The goal is to use as few dependencies as possible to guarantee a **small final bundle**. Also to keep the code clean, small and simple.

## Getting started
Choose a package you want to install. It's as easy as that:
```sh
npm install --save @smoovy/<package>
```

## Roadmap 2020
- [ ] ðŸ“¦ Create `@smoovy/parallax` (parallax effect math)
- [ ] ðŸ“¦ Create `@smoovy/timeline` (timeline for tweens)
- [ ] ðŸ“¦ Create `@smoovy/text-split` (easy text splitting)
- [ ] ðŸ’¡ Improve tween demos

## Workflow
This is a simple monorepo consisting of some of the packages mentioned above.
> Every command related to a package will be executed from the root directory via `scripty`

### Building a package
To ensure the best result, packages are created with rollup. The following formats are supported: `cjs`, `umd` and `esm`.
```sh
npm run build:package <name>
```

### Testing a package
Packages will be tested with `jest` and `puppeteer`. The sources files will be used for testing.
```sh
npm run test:package <name>
```
> Some packages are still missing tests. These will be excluded from the code coverage completely.

### Serving a package demo
The demo will be served and bundled with `parcel`. Every demo must have a `index.html` file.
The source files will be used for the demo.
```sh
npm run serve:package <name> [<demo>, default]
```

### Linting a package
The `TSLinter` is used for linting packages. Everything except the `src` folder will be ignored.
```sh
npm run lint:package <name>
```
