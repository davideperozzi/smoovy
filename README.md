## Synopsis
**smoovy** is just a collection of small and useful js packages preventing copy & paste. The goal is to use as minimum dependencies as possible to guarantee a **small final bundle**. Also to keep the code clean, small and simple.

## Workflow
This is simple monorepo consisting of the packages mentioned above.
> Every commands related to a package will be executed from the root directory via `scripty`

### Building a package
To ensure the best result, packages are created with rollup. The following formats are supported: `cjs`, `umd` and `esm`.
```sh
npm run build:package <name>
```

### Testing a package
Packages will be tested with `jest`. The dist files will be used for testing.
```sh
npm run test:package <name>
```

### Serving a package demo
The demo will be served and bundled with `parcel`. Every demo must have a `index.html` file.
The source files will be used for the demo.
```sh
npm run serve:package <name> [<demo>, default]
```

### Linting a package
The `TSLinter` is used for linting packages. Everything except the `src` folder will be ignored.
```sh
npm run lint:package <name>
```
